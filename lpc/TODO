I will use this to note pending work for future commits.

This version is at a clean compile and infact php -i works fine.

Next stage is to sort out and debug the cache implementation so that LPC works in its culled APC mode: 
that is with a full "shared" cache but in unpool process space with the old compile to shared cache mode.
