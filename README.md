php-extensions
==============

Lightweight Program Cache for PHP based on a fork of APC and optimized for CLI and CGI use.

With the open-sourcing and releasing of the OPcache acceletator, and w.e.f. PHP 5.5, its 
inclusion in the PHP core, I have decided to suspend all work on LPC to focus on an equivalent 
OPcache-based accelerator, (MLC-OPcache) [https://github.com/TerryE/opcache].
